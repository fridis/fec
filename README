What is FEC?
============

FEC is an Eiffel-Compiler for SUN/SPARC V8 running Solaris. It implements 
most of Eiffel V3 as defined in [Meyer92]. See below for the language 
features that haven't been implemented in this version.

FEC directly creates SPARC machine code and saves it as ELF object 
files.



Requirements: 
=============

To use FEC, the gnu C compiler gcc is required. The compiler is used 
only as a linker to create an executable program from the object
files of an Eiffel System.



Installation:
=============

To install FEC, it is sufficient to unpack the archive file using 

	> gzip -d fec0.03.tar.gz
	> tar -xf fec0.03.tar
	
The archive contains the following files and directories:

fec/                  The main directory
fec/fec               The executeable of the compiler, compiled using fec
fec/fecc              The executeable compiled using all runtime checks.
                      (use this compiler to track down a compiler crash)
fec/std_lib/*.e       Eiffel library classes
fec/std_lib/fec_lib.c C-source for some basic routines used by the compiler.
fec/obj/              This drawer is used to store the object files for
                      classes compiled by FEC
fec/obj/fec_lib.o     Object file containing basic routines needed by every 
                      Eiffel System. This file was compiled using 
                      "gcc -c -o obj/fec_lib.o std_lib/fec_lib.c".
fec/src/*.e           Some example classes
fec/elink             This is a script file created by fec for every project.
                      It can be used to link a system using gcc.
fec/fec_src/          The source of the compiler and environment-files for
                      fec and fecc.



Usage of the compiler:
======================

To use the compiler, you should first change the current directory to the
directory containing your project (this directory must contain the sub-
directory "obj/"). To compile one of the given example programs, go to
the fec directory:

	> cd fec 

The command FEC expects one argument that specifies the name of an 
environment file (a very simple LACE) describing your project. If such
a file is not present, a default file is created by the compiler:

	> fec hello
	FEC -- Fridi's Eiffel Compiler V0.03 (29-Aug-97)
	 + hello.env
	Environment file created. Start FEC again to compile Eiffel System.

The second call of fec now compiles the example system with root class
"HELLO.e": 

	> fec hello
	FEC -- Fridi's Eiffel Compiler V0.03 (29-Aug-97)
	 - hello.env
	 - src/HELLO.e
	 - std_lib/ANY.e
	 - std_lib/GENERAL.e
	 - std_lib/LOW_LEVEL.e
	 - std_lib/POINTER.e
	 - std_lib/POINTER_REF.e
	 - std_lib/HASHABLE.e
	 - std_lib/INTEGER.e
	 - std_lib/INTEGER_REF.e
	 - std_lib/NUMERIC.e
	 - std_lib/COMPARABLE.e
	 - std_lib/BOOLEAN.e
	 - std_lib/BOOLEAN_REF.e
	 - std_lib/STRING.e
	 - std_lib/ARRAY.e
	 - std_lib/STD_FILES.e
	 - std_lib/CHARACTER.e
	 - std_lib/CHARACTER_REF.e
	 - std_lib/PLATFORM.e
	 - std_lib/DOUBLE.e
	 - std_lib/DOUBLE_REF.e
	 - std_lib/REAL.e
	 - std_lib/REAL_REF.e
	 - std_lib/FILE.e

	 + obj/real_ref.o
	 + obj/main.o
	 + elink
	ok.
	132276 Bytes machinencode created.
	
The compiler first searches for the source text files in the directories
given in the environment file (see below). The file names for the source 
texts must be identical to their class names with an suffix ".e". The file 
names must be written using either only lower case or only upper case 
letters. The suffix ".e" must be in lower case.

The compiler reads all required source texts and checks their validity. If 
that was successful, it continues and creates object files for all classes 
involved in the system and stores them in the "obj/" folder (if this folder
is missing, it will not be able to create those files). The object files 
have the names of their base classes, possibly with actual generic 
arguments, and the suffix ".o".

Finally, a main object file for the system is created and saved as 
"obj/main.o". To ease the linking process, a script-file "elink" is 
created. This must be executable (type "chmod 700 elink" if it isn't) and
can now be used to link the compiled system to an executable program:

	> elink

Note that linking only works, if the object file "fec_lib.o" is present
in the "obj/" subdirectory, so you have to copy this file from fec/obj/
if you are working in a different directory. 

The name given in the environment file is used as name for the
executable program. The default environment file uses the name of the
root class in lower case letters, so we can start the example using

	> hello



The Environment File
====================

Environment files are used instead of command-line arguments to describe
all information needed by the compiler to create a system, like names of
the root-class, loading paths, required runtime checks, etc. Environment
files are always written entirely in lower or upper case letters, and have
the suffix ".env" in lower case. 

The default environment file created above when compiling "HELLO.e" looks
like this:

	-- Eiffel project environment:
	
	-- Root class for this system:
	ROOT_CLASS hello
	-- Root creation procedure:
	ROOT_CREATION make
	
	-- Checking Mode:
	-- Set this to one of NONE, REFERENCE, REQUIRE, ENSURE, INVARIANT, LOOP, ALL or DEBUG
	CHECK ALL
	
	-- Name of executable program to create:
	EXECUTABLE hello
	
	-- Load path to look for source texts:
	LOADPATH
	LOADPATH src/
	LOADPATH std_lib/
	
	-- Either "gcc" or "cc" may be used to link the system:
	LINKER gcc

The format of the file is very simple: Lines are either empty, comments 
(preceeded by --) or commands that begin with a keyword. The following
commands may be specified:

ROOT_CLASS <name>
	This selects the root class of the system to be compiled
	
ROOT_CREATION <name>
	Here you can specify the name of the root creation procedure to be
	used for creating your system.
	
CHECK (NONE | REFERENCE | REQUIRE | ENSURE | INVARIANT | LOOP | ALL | DEBUG)
	This selects the level of runtime checks to be used. Only one of the 
	key words NONE, REFERENCE, etc. must be specified. The keywords given 
	here are in order of strictness, so every keyword includes all the 
	runtime-checks of the previous checking modes. They have the following 
	meaing: 
	
	NONE       No code for runtime checks is created. 
	REFERENCE  Reference variables are checked for Void when they are used
	REQUIRE    Preconditions are checked.
	ENSURE     Postconditions are checked (currently not implemented).
	INVARIANT  Class invariants are checked (currently not implemented).
	LOOP       Loop (in-)variants are checked (currently not implemented).
	ALL        Code for the CHECK-instructions is created.
	DEBUG      Code for the DEBUG-instructions is created.

EXECUTABLE <name>
	This selects the name of the executable to be created for the system.

LOADPATH [<path>]
	This keyword can be given several times to specify an arbitrary number
	of paths the compiler uses to search for source texts. If no path
	is given, the current directory is used as well. The paths are 
	searched in the order given in the environment file, so if several
	source texts for a given class exist, the one in the first path 
	specified will be used.
	
LINKER <name>
	Here you can select your favorite program to be used to create the
	executable from the object files. This can be either "gcc" or "cc".
	
	
	
Standard Classes:
=================

As documentation for the standard classes, please refer to their source
texts as given in "std_lib/". The standard classes should conform to the
standard given in [ELKS95]. Many features are currently not implemented
(they are marked in the source text with "nyi", which stands for "not yet 
implemented"), many of the implemented features are not tested. So please
use these classes with special care.

Since FILE.e is hardly tested and lacks the implementation of many features, 
this beta-version also includes modified versions of the file classes 
STD_FILE, STD_FILE_READ, STD_FILE_WRITE and STD_FILE_READ_WRITE of 
Dominique Colnet's Compiler SmallEiffel [Colnet97].

The compiler relies on some of the standard classes to be exactly as they
are. Modification in those classes may lead to unpredictable behaviour. 



Sample Code: 
============

The directory "src/" contains the source texts of several example classes. 
The root classes are:

	HELLO.e        Rocking Hello-World demo
	TEST_ALL.e     A combination of several small demos
	HEXDUMP.e      A small program that prints a hexdump of a file given as
	               shell argument



Bug-Reports:
============

As this compiler is very new and not sufficiently tested, it might still have
a significant number of bugs. In case you think you have encountered a 
problem, I would be glad if you took the time to send me a detailed 
description of the problem, so that I can easily reproduce it myself. In most
cases, the best way to report a problem is by sending me a minimal example
source text that produces false behaviour by the compiler.

Before your report a problem to me, please check the not-yet-implemented list
below. There is no point in reporting a problem I already know of, you would
just waste your and my time. 

Please send Bugreports via EMail to: 

	fridi@gr.opengroup.org
	Subject: BUG: ...



Not-Yet-Implemented:
====================

Note that most of the features that are not implemented do not cause the
compiler to create a warning message. Instead it jsut creates code that 
crashes.

- Incremental compilation is currently not supported.

- The library classes are still incomplete and do not completely conform to
  the ELKS standard.

- Some Assertions (postconditions, invariants, variants) are not checked.
  
- strip, old, retry and rescue do not work

- Bit types are not supported

- The default initialization procedure of expanded attributes of the root 
  object is not called automatically.

- Redeclaring arguments and function results that are references to a
  conforming expanded type is not supported. The same holds for 
  redeclaration of INTEGER as REAL/DOUBLE and REAL as DOUBLE.

- An object of an actual generic class C[Q] cannot be used through a 
  reference of type C[P] (Q conforms to P). Assignment_attempt of
  C[Q] to C[P] fails.

- the constants listed in an inspect compoud must lie in the range of
  -4096..4095 and the difference between two consecutive constants must
  not be more than 4095.

- Constant numeric expressions may crash the compiler (causing a division
  by zero or an overflow)

- The memory used for the type information for a system with n classes 
  is in O(n^2). This can be reduced significantly.

- The garbage-collector is not implemented.

- Expception handling is not supported.

- System Validity is not checked.

- The compiler deserves a better name than FEC.

- This list is incomplete.



Thanks:
=======

Without the help of the following people, this project would not have been
possible:

Prof. Plödereder and Bernd Holzmüller accepted this project as subject for
my final universitiy thesis. Without them, I would not have found sufficient
time for the project.

Dominique Colnet provided a good portable Eiffel compiler that I could use
to bootstrap my compiler. I benefited a lot from the usage of SmallEiffel
and the possibility to inspect the C code created by this compiler.

Roger Browne is clearly the one who wrote the most helpful replies to Eiffel
problems posted to comp.lang.eiffel.

Achim Siebert drawing the Eiffel logo.

My thanks in advance go to anybody who goes through the trouble of using
an early beta version of a compiler and for reporting any problem with it.



Anti-Thanks:
============

The following people and institutions tried hard not to be of any use in 
my project:

The IPVR at the Universitaet Stuttgart refused to allow me to use one of their 
(unused) ISE Eiffel licenses to bootstrap my compiler.

SPARC International makes it extra hard for any non-commercial developer to 
get detailed information on their processors, unless you register as a 
developer for 500 bucks a year... Have a look at IBM: They provide things
like a very useful "The PowerPC Compiler Writer's Guide" that anybody
can download for free.
